    <!-- Overview -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This course introduces you to <b>performance testing</b> with <b>Apache JMeter</b>, 
        one of the most widely used open-source tools for load testing. You will learn how 
        to create and execute performance test plans, analyze results, and optimize system 
        behavior under various load conditions. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to 
        perform effective load, stress, and endurance testing on web applications, APIs, and databases.
